# Snake 2077

I made this cyberpunk themed snake game for a hackathon, but also as a javascript refresher after a break I had.

[Live Site](https://sanberkhax.github.io/snake-2077/)

All JavaScript code is in a single file on purpose, I just wanted to have fun with this.

Also there is a Mac related issue that crashes the game, sorry Mac users.

## There's an intro that explains every mechanic of the game, so don't skip the intro.
